# <p align="center"> NIH Cloud Platform Interoperability (NCPI) Program </p>

Welcome to the NCPI GitHub page! 

The NCPI program is a partnership between multiple NIH-supported participating systems (currently AnVIL, BioData Catalyst, CRDC, dbGaP, and Kids First) developing and implementing technical standards to enable interoperability and facilitate a federated data ecosystem.

The purpose of this page is to serve as a technical hub for the NCPI community including providing:
- Information on the current interoperability work that is occurring
- Introductions and links to the services and tools that are fundamental to NCPI

## Repository Overview

The following table provides a quick overview of the organization of the NCPI GitHub:
